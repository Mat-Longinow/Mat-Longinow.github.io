# My Programming Journey Read Me


### Thanks for taking a look at my Read Me file!

While there aren't many instructions here, I mainly want to convey the following:

#### Why?

I am creating this site so that I can document and convey my personal journey with the world of programming and coding, in all it's joy's and frustrations.

#### How?

This site will be entirely built by me, as a way to practice what I know already, and also continue to learn and grow the skills that I have.

I will be using:

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript/jQuery

#### What?

This site will contain three basic elements:

* My journey
* My notes
* My projects
