							<h2 class="red-font blog-title">My Progress Thus Far</h2>

							<p>Most of my story (in brief at least) is found on the home page of my site (here in case you missed it). So I won't repeat myself too much, but to briefly review, I was a tech-savy and nerfy child that ended up in a UI Internship right after college where I find my love for programming!</p>

							<p>It's funny how long ago that seems and how much has happened in the meantime! So the point of this blog? To try and catch you up to speed with where I am now, where I am wanting to head, and what has happened along the way</p>
							
							<h4><u>Post Internship</u></h4>

							<p>Two major things that happened next, that I won't go in to right now (blogs on these coming later). The first was that surprisingly my internship experience wasn't the greatest experience and the more that I learn and grow, and look back, the more I see some flaws not just in the company that hosted the internship, but with possible industry cultural trends as well (more of my thoughts on this later). However a saving grace to my journey came in the form of an uncle of mine (more like superhero maybe?) who reached out to me when he heard I was doing my internship. Though our families were close, I actually had never known what he did for a living (funny, right?). Turns out he had his masters in software engineering and was a Software Engineer Manager. Over the next year or so, even thought I had already found other non-technical employment, every time he would see me or talk with me he would tell me, "You could be great at this if you chose to pursue this Mat." Honestly folks, believing in people goes a long way (another blog down the road as well).</p>

							<p>So another year or so goes by and I hadn't done much with coding, but once again, it was this nagging thing in the back of my mind that I think I subconsciously determined to pursue in one capacity or another as I got older. So I gave my uncle a call and asked if he would help give me pointers and coach me on how to learn and grow my coding skillz (always the z).</p>

							<p>So that led me to begin doing lots of research on blogs, training sites, and other technical sites to figure out how in the world I could develop myself as a coder.</p>

							<p>I began to quickly realize a couple things:</p>

							<ol>
								<li><p>The programming world was WAY bigger than I had thought it was (there is only so much an internship can show you).</p></li>

								<li><p>I was in a bit of a difficult place because I did not have the time or money to pursue programming in an official capacity (bootcamps, degrees, etc)</p></li>

								<li><p>The copious amounts of resources out there was actually a HINDRENCE.</p></li>
							</ol>

							<h4><u>It's A Big World Out There</u></h4>

							<p>At first it was super daunting to me when I would read that the programming world was constantly evolving with new technology, language nuances, frameworks, etc were constantly coming out and most programmers are constantly learning.</p>

							<p>I mean think about it, you go to take a college course and the professor hands you a syllabus with a bunch of stuff to learn, but then announces, "Oh by the way, this syllabus will continue to change and expand as time goes on, so you will always have something more to learn." I would have dropped that class like third period french (which I never took, just trying to use those cool kid colloquial sayings).</p>

							<p>So needless to say that as I began diving in, already feeling intimidated, just to learn that things would continue to change and there would always be more to learn did not improve my confidence level.</p>

							<p>So what changed that? Practice and people's stories. As I began to build projects and saw that I actually could learn things and make sense of complicated processes, it boosted my courage to progress. Alongside that, people sharing their stories about their own success learning, growing and meeting milestones (interviews, jobs, career changes, etc) also gave me hope that I too could have their story.</p>

							<p>I also can't forget the foundational motivator as well: I just stinkin' love to code.</p>

							<h4><u>Feeling Stuck</u></h4>

							<p>I am 26, and have been married for 4 years and have a new son. I have moved, made career changes and have struggle financially at times. Why am I saying this? To me it is a seemingly cruel joke looking in to 10 hour-a-day, 3 month-long bootcamps or returning to school to get a CS degree. I am just not in the place financially or life-wise to make such sacrifices right now. They seem very tantalizing and attractive, but just not something I can do at this point.</p>

							<p>So I am stuck having to self-teach.</p>

							<p>Thankfully, though, I have found lots of resources and continue to hear that self-teaching is in fact a very viable way to build yourself into a programmer, even if it has its own pitfalls.</p>

							<h4><u>Too Many Resources</u></h4>

							<p>It has been incredible to see how many classes, blogs, youtube video series, etc there are on developing programming skills. However, and maybe this is just me, this has actually turned into a hindrance to me as I have tried to learn. With so many options, which do I pick? Maybe I should do a CSS course here, or Ruby projects over there...</p>

							<p>Without a "syllabus" that pulls things together with a very clear and proven outcome, it can often feel like trying to hack together a bunch of different random important but disconnected threads.</p>

							<p>Not only that but you run into teaching styles and opinions. Some people say this, some contradict and say that. It can be quite confusing at times.</p>

							<h4><u>So Where Am I Now?</u></h4>

							<p>So in light of everything above, where am I now? Well in some ways I am sorting that out myself as well. I know that I want to build a career in coding. I know I am dedicated to learning. This site along is a manifestation of both of those things. But I am still figuring out what means exactly. For now I am simply trying to stay dedicated to put in the hours learning and practicing to hone in on things learned and things known.</p>

							<p>So as I build projects and continue to grow myself, I will update this site with projects and thoughts.</p>

							<p>Thank you for following my journey, whoever you are! I hope you enjoy it and catch some inspiration along the way.</p>
