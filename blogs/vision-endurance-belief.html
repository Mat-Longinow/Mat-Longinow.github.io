							<h2 class="red-font blog-title">Vision, Endurance and Belief</h2>

							<p>It's been awhile (almost a year) since my last blog post. A lot has changed! My son has grown up a lot (he is now almost 9 months old! wowzers...) and I have moved across the state of California, gone through some tumultuous situations and landed a really wonderful new job.</p>

							<p>Through a lot of that I have had time to reflect and really think more about this journey into programming. It has not been easy, it has not come overnight, but it has been something I have come back to again and again. I guess that's what dreams do, as they say, "dream's never die."</p>

							<p>So as I have pursued this continuing dream of learning more and more of this world of programming, I have found some common themes that have had great influence (both positively and negatively) on my journey.</p>

							<ol>
								<li><b>Vision (and sometimes the lack of it)</b></li>
								<li><b>Endurance</b></li>
								<li><b>Belief</b></li>
							</ol>

							<p>Let's begin..</p>

							<h4><u>1. Vision</u></h4>

							<p>I had mentioned this in my last post, but often times the road of a self-taught programmer can be quite murky and sometimes dumbfoundingly dizzying as you attempt to feel that you are actually making headway towards your goals. Why? For one I think often the goal "I want to learn how to program" or "I want to get marketable skills in programming to land a job" can feel very ambiguous as time passes. Job listings can be vague or comepletely different from one another, this article will suggest doing this, while another suggests another path. You find some victory in "learning programming" while then suddenly stumbling into areas of your language that feel WAY over your head. All if this can lead to a feeling of 2 steps forward 10 steps backwards sometimes.</p>

							<p>I personally have found this to be quite exhausting and discouraging and it has caused me to lay aside programming for a couple weeks or so at a time. But then, something will remind me of why I love coding and why I am determined to learn it, and away I go once more.</p>

							<p>What has all of this taught me? Vision is KEY.</p>

							<p>You see, there is a reason why Codecademy and it's like are all so popular. You learn lots of things (as you would if you read a textbook, or did some research online), but what is truly thrilling about the process is... you FEEL as though you are learning. How is this accomplished? Vision.</p>

							<p>With the above example, you know exactly what you are hoping to get out of each module (the vision) and then you can track how far you are to your end goal (steps toward the vision). With this you actually are fueled by a sense or success at each step, you can almost feel the vision getting closer and closer as you progress.</p>

							<p>Now I understand that example is a bit black and white and in almost every work situation you will find nuances that don't allow for that experience, but I think that I have learned a valuable lesson nonetheless. You cannot find success without a clear vision and clear steps towards that vision.</p>

							<p>In programming, I have found that when I am working on something specific (a project, a website, a client's freelancing gig) I am most enthralled and focused and able to really enjoy my process and grow. Why is that? I am focused on a clear vision, a clear objective that I can track my progress with and feel a sense of completion with. So, instead of having the ambiguous goal of "learning coding" or "gaining marketable skills towards a job", instead breaking that down into what exactly I want to achieve and what I think the best steps to achieve that goal really are.</p>

							<h4><u>2. Endurance</u></h4>

							<p>Sometimes, you just gotta do it (to take a note from Nike). You see, sometimes willpower has to kick in and you just need to push yourself. I have definitely seen this in the realm of coding. Sometimes I am feeling it, sometimes I am not. Once I am able to really push myself past that boundary that says, "wouldn't you rather be...?" and I force myself to sit down and work on something, I often find that I am able to really enjoy the process and am energized. Not always, but often.</p>

							<p>Not only that, but the mental dedication to pick up where I left off even if that was two weeks ago because I got busy has been a, sometimes difficult but, enjoyable experience to really pursue (even if not perfectly) something with a doggedness that doesn't quit no matter how messy it feels.</p>

							<p>I feel this building my character and I feel this muscle growing stronger in me.</p>

							<h4><u>3. Belief</u></h4>

							<p>I also had mentioned this, but what really started me on this journey in the first place (outside of really finding that I loved something) was belief. My Uncle believed in me (and still does) to the point of reassuring and encouraging me in this direction. I continue to be surprised by how powerful this really is.</p>

							<p>Often times the learning process is a mind game, an emotional roller coaster of sorts, and feeling belief in yourself in the journey is a very, very powerful tool. I have had the privilege of having someone close to me that believes in me, but I also have felt encouraged just by people in the industry who have a positive attitude about people learning the craft.</p>

							<p>One great example of this is <a hredf="www.skillcrush.com">Skillcrush</a>. These people are DRIPPING with positivity when it comes to newbies learning to code. While I have not taken any sort of course from them, I have been greatly impacted by their emails, blog posts and all around enthusiasm. One of their main missions is to demystify the coding world and debunk the lies that often times keep people from pursuing something they might really love. Most of the time this comes from a simple, "No, you CAN do this." Things like that hold so much power I think and have definitely been shots of adrenaline in the arm to me in this journey.</p>

							<p>So where does that leave me? Well, I like to think of myself as moving forward, overcoming obstacles and learning to enjoy the ride. Do I know what lies ahead in the next few months? Not at all. However, I am coming to appreciate the journey more and more and value the life lessons I am picking up as I pursue my dream.</p>
