I am a <span class="lead">follower of Jesus</span>, a <span class="lead">lover of milk</span> (yes the kind that comes from a cow), a <span class="lead">foodie at heart</span>, a <span class="lead">budding DND'er</span> (is that the term? meh, it works), and a <span class="lead">proud husband and recent father</span>.</p>

							<p>But that is not why you are here. You are here because I am creating a website to devote to the newest item on my list of what I am, or at least want to be: <span class="lead red-font">a coder.</span></p>

							<p>My tale goes back a ways, in fact all the way back to a middle school computer club where me and my somewhat nerdy friends (I'm still in denial) learned all sorts of cool things. But more on that in down below!</p>

							<p><span class="lead">Remeber that part about my <span class="red-font">family</span>?</span> Well, to the right you will see that my little family consists of <span class="lead">myself</span> (just look for the massive beard), my wife <span class="lead">Miriam</span> (the pretty one), and our new little baby boy <span class="lead">Aiden Graham</span> (the sleepy one)

							<p>I have been married to my wife, Miriam, for about 4 years now. We both met at Biola University (amazing school, check it out you youngsters), where we both were serving in the Student Missionary Union together (Missions = Soulmates, amiright stereotypical Christian memes?).</p>

							<p>We were proud and happy to find this past year that we were pregnant by the grace of God (another amazing story for another time), and after 9 long (and yet short?) months, Aiden came to join our family on May 27, 2017 at 4am (my wife kicked butt getting him here).<p>

							<p>Fun fact about Aiden, my wife and I couldn't decided on what to name him up until he had arrived! Once we held in for the first time, I said, <span class="lead">"Baby, we gotta pick a name now. No more stalling!"</span> and Aiden was aptly named shortly after.</p>

							<p>Aiden means little fire (of God of course), and Graham comes from Graham Cooke, a speaker and teacher in the Church that has been extremely influential to Miriam and I both, and someone we hope Aiden will grow up to be like.</p>
