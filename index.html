							<p>I have been married to my wife, Miriam, for about 4 years now. We both met at Biola University (amazing school, check it out you youngsters), where we both were serving in the Student Missionary Union together.</p>

							<p>We were proud and happy to find this past year that we were pregnant by the grace of God (another amazing story for another time), and after 9 long (and yet short?) months, Aiden came to join our family on May 27, 2017 at 4am (my wife kicked butt getting him here). Aiden means "little fire" (of God of course), and Graham comes from Graham Cooke, a speaker and teacher in the Church that has been extremely influential to Miriam and I both, and someone we hope Aiden will grow up to be like.</p>

							<h3>How Did I Get Here?</h3>
						</div>

						<div class="col-sm-6 no-float">
							<p>Let me back up first to my elementary school days. I remember going to Target and bringing back <i>The War Of The Ring</i> because of course I was an avid LOTR fan as well as a lover of Age Of Empires. I put in the disk to my families deskptop and, "uh oh". <span class="lead">IT DIDN'T WORK.</span> I had no idea what to do. I was devestated. I had been so excited to play this game! So what did I do? Well, I don't remembe what led me to do this, but I opened up the program files thinking that somehow I would tinker around, open some files and get the darn thing to work.</p>

							<p>Guess what? <span class="lead">It worked!</span> To this day I don't remember what I did exactly, but I got the game to work and not only was I happy to play my game, but I felt a sense of accomplishment that I had tackled the technical challenge before me.</p>

							<p>As I grew up I quickly became the "techy" of the family, and most computer problems were just handed to me to fix if I could. If not, we would always run to Best Buy to talk to the "experts".</p>

							<p>Then in 6th grade I was invited to be a part of the computer club at my school where I learned many things, one of them being HTML. I remember we each created our own website on geocities (RIP), and of course mine was dedicated to... you guessed it, LOTR.</p>

							<p>Fast forward to post college and I find myself at a UI internship where I am learning to code. All of my joyful HTML chidlhood memories came flooding back to me as I spent hours on Codecademy learning how to program.</p>

							<p>While I didn't end up staying with that company, I walked away from that intnership with "the itch". I had to learn more! I had found that <span class="lead red-font">I LOVE TO CODE!</span> The mental workout, the satisfaction of seeing something work, it was just too much for me. I had found a new passion.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-6 no-float">
							<p><span class="lead">This website is dedicated to my <span class="red-font">journey with programming</span>.</span> That internship was many years ago and though I had learned that I loved to code, I didn't quite realize how big of a world coding and programming was! I was in for a bit of a rude awakening in some ways.</p>

							<p>But I have stuck with it for the last several years and though my time and attention on programming has waxed and waned, I have kept coming back to it. I am currently at the place where I am wanting this to become a career path for myself, and am trying to lean in to learning coding more intentionally these days.</p>

							<p>So this website serves two purposes: <span class="lead"><span class=:red-font>documenting</span> and <span class="red-font">practicing</span>.</span></p>

							<p>It is for documenting my journey with my learning. Challenges I've faced. Things I've noticed about the industry. My personal experience as a aspiring coder. It also will be a place where I will showcase some of my projects for you all to take a look at. Who knows, maybe this will lead to a job? (Fingers crossed).</p>

							<p>It is also for practicing! I am going to be coding this website from scratch using:</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>HTML</li>
								<li>CSS</li>
								<li>Bootstrap</li>
								<li>JavaScript</li>
								<li>jQuery</li>
							</ul>

							<p>To view my code, you can always check it out on my <a href="https://github.com/Mat-Longinow/Mat-Longinow.github.io">GitHub profile</a>. I am building this site on GitHub Pages, so even the code I am writing for this website will be viewable.</p>

							<p>I hope and pray that if you (whoever you are) take the time to look through my site, that you will be encouraged and inspired to work towards your dreams and not give up.</p>

							<p><span class="lead">So join me in my <span class="red-font">journey!</span></span></p>
