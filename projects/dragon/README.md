# Dragon Fightin'

This was a project that I developed as my final project during my time in a UI Internship with Liferay.


#### Instructions

The instrcutions given to me were to create a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (specifically AUI). So everything on the design and development process was done solely by me.

#### Final Product

My final product can be found and viewed by opening the Dragon_Fightin.html in a browser.
