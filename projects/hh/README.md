# Hope & Healing

This was a project that I developed for a non-profit client. I used a bootstrap based template and customized it according to their desire.


#### Template

I left the template in the files to be able to see the difference between the original template and my final product. The template is labeled as (Orignial Template).html.

#### Final Product

My final product can be found and viewed by opening the index.html in a browser.

#### Contact

Feel free to contact me with any questions!
